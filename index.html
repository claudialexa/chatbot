            <p class="lead">Using natural language processing and machine learning, we created an application that provides citizens with the information they most want and need during weather disasters.

            <p class="lead">After speaking to residents and hearing their concerns, we knew we wanted to make something that would make their lives before, during, and after a flood much easier. Thus, we created Iris, a chatbot that serves as the ultimate customer service assistant during a weather emergency that helps users easily connect to information and government services. </p>

            <p>Iris sends you alerts on your phone before, during, and after a storm to keep you updated with important weather and safety information. Alerts are more than just weather, they also include important information from city officials, notifications you subscribed to (for example from your power company) and local news headlines from a recent storm event. If you want Iris to keep watch on your local grocery store opens, she can also do that and send you an alert when they re-open.<p></div>

            <h4>Trying to Avoid a Flooded Route</h4>
            <p class="lead">One of the biggest concerns for residents when a flood occurs is getting back home when streets begin to get flooded. Due to bad drainage, many roads can get so flooded that many cars can’t make it out. Iris makes avoiding these streets easy with voice command: you can ask it to find flooded areas or to take you home avoiding flooded streets.</p>

            <h4>Finding the Nearest Open Gas Station</h4>
            <p class="lead">After a weather emergency there are few apps that will tell you actual operating hours of businesses near you. This often means either searching the web, calling around, or avoiding going out to shops altogether. Unfortunately, when there is a weather emergency, there are certain trips that cannot be avoided, such as getting gas. Iris provides you with updated business hours and businesses near you that are open.</p>

            <h4>Reporting a Closed Business</h4>
            <p class="lead">AfterStorm’s information crowdsourcing feature makes it quick and easy to report opening hours for everything from a store to a shelter as well as potential risks during a flood: power lines that are down, flood debris, water contamination, etc). AfterStorm was <i>made for reporting</i>, which can be done via voice or with just a few typed commands.</p>
