            <p class="lead">One of the biggest concerns for residents when a flood occurs is getting back home when streets begin to get flooded. Due to bad drainage, many roads can get so flooded that many cars can’t make it out. AfterStorm makes avoiding these streets easy with voice command: you can ask it to find flooded areas or to take you home avoiding flooded streets.</p>

            <h4>Finding the Nearest Open Gas Station</h4>
            <p class="lead">After a weather emergency there are few apps that will tell you actual operating hours of businesses near you. This often means either searching the web, calling around, or avoiding going out to shops altogether. Unfortunately, when there is a weather emergency, there are certain trips that cannot be avoided, such as getting gas. Iris provides you with updated business hours and businesses near you that are open.</p>

AfterStorm was <i>made for reporting</i>, which can be done via voice or with just a few typed commands.</p>
